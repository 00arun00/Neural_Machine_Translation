# Neural_Machine_Translation
This project focuses on building a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model to translate human readable dates ("25th of June, 2009") into machine readable dates ("2009-06-25"), using  attention model.

** Libraries **
- Keras
- Faker
- Numpy
- Random

** Note **  
Since glove vectors are very large git hub couldn't be used to host it. I have currently hosted it using my google drive please download it using the following link https://drive.google.com/file/d/12Es5Ks0f4p9cpR1vbqODfj4VYsbp_A9d/view?usp=sharing and save a copy in data folder with the name "glove.6B.50d.txt"
